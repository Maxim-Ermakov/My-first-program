                    In 1909 Ettore Bugatti founded his own company[1]. As a factory, he used an abandoned dye factory in
                    Molsem.

                    Bugatti Type 13 appeared in 1910 and at the French Grand Prix in 1911, driven by Ernest Friedrich,
                    took second place, overtaking more powerful cars.

                    After the First World War, a slightly modified Type 13 won the Passenger Car Cup at Le Mans in 1920.
                    Based on the Type 13, Bugatti Type 15, 17, 22 and 23 models were created with different chassis
                    lengths. Bugatti Type 22 with a 16-valve engine took the first four places in the Brescia Grand Prix
                    in 1921, for which the Type models 13, 15, 17, 22, 23, 27 with 16-valve engines, they received the
                    nickname "Brescia".

                    The Bugatti Type 18, a supercar of its time, was introduced in 1912. The 100 hp engine could
                    accelerate the car up to 160 km/h. A total of 7 copies were created.

                    In 1923, the Bugatti Type 32 was created, nicknamed "Tank". The car has played a pioneering role in
                    terms of attention to aerodynamics in the design of racing cars.

                    Bugatti Type 35, which appeared in 1924, became one of the most successful racing cars of its time,
                    with more than 2,000 victories. Type 35 and its modifications won the Grand Prix of Spain, France,
                    Germany, Monaco, Czechoslovakia; for five years they held the first place in the Targa Florio races.
                    For the first time, a horseshoe-shaped radiator grille appeared in the Bugatti Type 35 design, which
                    has become a distinctive element of many of the company's cars. The car became the "calling card" of
                    the company and was a success with wealthy buyers.

                    In 1926, the Bugatti Type 41 Royale appeared — it was one of the most luxurious and expensive cars
                    of its time.

                    In the early 1960s Ferruccio Lamborghini was the owner of several companies and could afford
                    buy expensive cars. At various times he had a Mercedes 300SL, several Maserati 3500
                    GT, Jaguar E-type. He also owned a Ferrari 250 GT of various versions. But in every car he found
                    some shortcomings. There are several versions about the reasons why Lamborghini founded his own
                    company. All these
                    versions boil down to a conflict between Enzo Ferrari (the owner of the Ferrari company) and
                    Ferruccio Lamborghini.
                    The most popular version, told by Ferruccio Lamborghini's son, says that Lamborghini arrived
                    to the factory to Enzo Ferrari to complain about the quality of the clutch in his Ferrari 250 GT
                    car. Enzo
                    I sent the Lamborghini back with a wish to continue working with tractors, because
                    Lamborghini doesn't understand anything about cars, let alone sports cars. Lamborghini returned to
                    the factory, disassembled
                    the transmission in his Ferrari 250 GT and found that the manufacturer of many parts is the same as
                    in
                    Lamborghini tractors. He found a suitable replacement in his warehouses, and after the assembly the
                    problem was
                    solved. Ferruccio decided that his car would have a V12 engine, this engine was also chosen by
                    economic reasons. Ferruccio attracted a talented engineer Giotto Bizzarini to his project
                    (Giotto Bizzarrini), owner of Bizzarrini S.p.A, who had previously developed V12 for
                    Ferrari. The prototype of the Lamborghini 350 GTV car was presented to the public at the Turin Auto
                    Show in October
                    1963[8]. In March 1964, the first production car Lamborghini 350 GT was shown. Sales
                    the production versions were very successful. Born under the sign of Taurus, Ferruccio Lamborghini
                    decorated car logo with the image of a bull. The success of the 350 GT model was followed by the
                    equally
                    successful Lamborghini 400 GT model, which brought there are enough funds to develop the first real
                    "pearl" of the company, the legendary Lamborghini
                    Miura. This prototype car was demonstrated by Ferruccio himself in November 1965 at the auto show in
                    Turin, and already in March 1966, a working version was presented at the Geneva Automobile
                    Exhibition. Miura was a great success — 111 cars were sold in 1967 alone — and the company received
                    fame all over the world. In 1971, Lamborghini again surprised the world with the prototype of the
                    new revolutionary Lamborghini Countach model. Although the car itself began to be produced only
                    three years later (in 1974), until that time it
                    remained in the spotlight at any auto show. The prototype had newfangled then vertically
                    opening doors, rear air intakes and a powerful 4-liter engine.
